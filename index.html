    <p class="author-desc">A Boston native living in Calgary, I've never waned away from his roots and still actively follow Boston sports teams.<br>
    I've been a Patriots fan since as long as I can remember, and anybody who questions whether Tom Brady is the GOAT has no place at this site<br>
    I still remember when the Celtics won it all back in '08, and its a shame that team couldn't get one more to cement their legacy.<br>
    Anyway, enough about me. If you're looking for sports updates on any of your favorite Boston teams, you've come to the right spot.<br>
    Its still a work in progress so bear with me, but for now hopefully you enjoy what I've got up. Go Boston!</p>

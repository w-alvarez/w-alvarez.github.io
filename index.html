    <p class="author-desc">A Boston native living in Calgary, I've never waned away from my roots and still actively follow Boston sports teams.
    I've been a Patriots fan since as long as I can remember, and anybody who questions whether Tom Brady is the GOAT has no place at this site.
    I still remember when the Celtics won it all back in '08, and its a shame that team couldn't get one more to cement their legacy.
    Anyway, enough about me. If you're looking for sports updates on any of your favorite Boston teams, you've come to the right spot.
    Its still a work in progress so bear with me, but for now hopefully you enjoy what I've got up. Go Boston!</p>
